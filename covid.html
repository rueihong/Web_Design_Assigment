      <h1>About COVID-19 in Malaysia</h1>
    </header>
	<section class="card">
	  <h2>Overview & Early Stage</h2>
      <p class="small">The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia began in January 2020 when the first cases were confirmed in Johor, linked to travelers from Singapore. 
	  At first, cases were mostly imported, but local transmission quickly grew after a large religious gathering in Kuala Lumpur sparked a nationwide outbreak.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="card">
	  <h2>Government Response</h2>
	  <p class="small">To protect public health, the government introduced the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020. This restricted travel, closed schools, limited public gatherings, and shut non-essential businesses. 
	  Over time, measures were adjusted through phases like the Conditional MCO (CMCO) and Recovery MCO (RMCO), depending on the number of cases.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="card">
	  <h2>Waves and Variants</h2>
	  <p class="small">Multiple waves of infections occurred, with new variants like Delta and Omicron contributing to spikes in cases. 
	  The healthcare system expanded its capacity by setting up quarantine centers, field hospitals, and increasing testing.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="card">
	  <h2>Vaccination Efforts</h2>
	  <p class="small">Malaysia’s vaccination program began in February 2021, offering free vaccines to all citizens and eligible residents. 
	  By 2022, more than 80% of the population was fully vaccinated, helping to reduce severe cases and deaths.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="card">
	  <h2>Living with COVID-19</h2>
	  <p class="small">Today, COVID-19 is managed as an endemic disease in Malaysia, with the focus on vaccination, personal health precautions, and targeted restrictions when necessary. 
	  The experience has left a lasting impact on public health policies, the economy, and the daily lives of Malaysians.</p>
